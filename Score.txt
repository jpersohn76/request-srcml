* Sometimes the resulting filename is returned. Other times it isn't. Why? -3
* Why a commented-out call to generate_srcml()) in the function request_language()? -2
* Filename can be "-" (indicating from standard input), but a language could be given. Logic wrong in generate_srcml() -2
* Does not compile: It is std::cerr, not std::err. -10
